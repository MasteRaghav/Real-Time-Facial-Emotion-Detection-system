# 🎭 Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection System

An **AI-powered real-time facial emotion recognition system** that analyzes live facial expressions using deep learning and computer vision, and adapts music playback based on the detected emotional state.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection System** is designed to recognize human emotions from facial expressions captured through a webcam. The system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **FER-2013 dataset** to accurately classify emotions such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, and Neutral** in real time.

To enhance user experience, the project integrates an **emotion-based music recommendation and music player module**, allowing the system to automatically suggest or play music according to the detected emotion. A **modern React-based frontend** ensures smooth interaction and real-time visualization, while the backend handles model inference and data processing efficiently.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Full-Stack Development** in building emotion-aware interactive systems.
